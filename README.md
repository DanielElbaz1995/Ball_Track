# Ball Tracking Car with Raspberry Pi and Arduino

This project demonstrates a robotic car that detects a ball using TensorFlow Lite on a Raspberry Pi and controls the car's movement using a PID controller on an Arduino Uno. The goal is to detect the ball in real time, center it within the camera frame, and drive toward it autonomously.
